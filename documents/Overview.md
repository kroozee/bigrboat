# Sharks with Lasers Overview
_v. 20230118.0_
## Lore
In the year 2123, government scientists (funded by a secret miliary initiative) have created a new line of genetically engineered sharks for the 22nd century oceanic battlefield. While the scientists have enjoyed great success on the biological side, they have struggled to train shark brains to be capable of effectively utilizing their bodily enhancements. In a last-ditch effort to produce some kind of positive result and secure those sweet, sweet military contracts for 2124, the scientists are turning to your crack team of software developers. They want you to completely replace the sharks' cerebral executive functions with a sophisticated AI.

Of course, the cause of securing government money is much too important to be left to a single team. Instead, your AI (and the shark controlled by it) will be competing against others to determine the best one. The stakes for this effort are high: national security, personal prestige, and the risk of being associated with failure.

## Just the Facts
Your team will be developing software to play a game called _Sharks with Lasers_ against other teams. While there may be one or two opportunities to test out your software against others, in the end it all comes down to a final battle where the shark with the most points wins.
